# Webcam Fun

##### What does it do?
The page allows us to save the words that we have said. We can save text on our computer.

##### How does the website work?
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to make the page. The website uses a microphone from user device and local storage to keep text.

##### Where did I get the idea for this website?
The beginning of the project was made during the "30-day JavaScript Challenge", but I expanded the project by adding 3 possible languages of recording. Additionally, I used local storage to prevent the text from deleting immediately after closing the page. I also added possibility to save the text in .txt file.
